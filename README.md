# Mail_System
Final project for 600.437 Distributed Systems

We want to build a fault tolerant mail service which consists of a mail server
program and a mail client program using anti-entropy protocol.
There are 5 mail servers (daemons) that run forever and may partition and re-
merge.
There are countless number of clients possible.
